      <h2>About Sweatshop Crafts</h2>
      <p>Sweatshop Crafts is what I call my fiber arts studio. The name is one part irony, two parts sarcasm, and one part education. I work really hard at my crafts and never make any money. So many times I've been told "you should sell those (quilts, socks, yarn, ect...), you'd make a fortune!" Really? How much would you pay for this pair of socks I'm knitting? Oh, five bucks? "Well, lets see.. the yarn cost about forty dollars. It will take me about ten hours to hand knit you a pair of socks, so if I charge minimum wage for labor..... " You get the idea. It's a sweatshop. I do it because I love it, but also because I'm interested in traditional crafts and keeping old skills alive.</p>

      <h2>About Nanci Villotti</h2>
      <p>I like to make stuff. I spin yarn, knit, crochet, weave, process and dye raw wool, hook rugs, and sometimes make soap. I can sew but itâ€™s not my favorite. I grew up on a self-sufficient, off the grid farm in Oregon and believe strongly in preserving our natural resources. I like to live simply, and reuse what I can.

      <h3>Raw Wool Processing</h3>

        <p>
          
          I like to buy whole fleeces from local shepherds and turn them into yarn and garments. This helps the sheep stay comfortable and healthy and helps the Shepard pay for the upkeep of the sheep. I like the idea of knowing a little about the sheep whose wool  im wearing on my back and contributing to helping to keep a small farmer in business.

          I wash small batches of the wool in warm water and Dawn dishsoap. This can be very labor intensive as the wool has to be picked through by hand to remove hay, seeds, twigs, poop, burrs, and general farm dirt. Once washed and air-dried I hand card most of the fleece before I spin it. Wool can be dyed before spinning or after its spun into yarn. I custom dye all of my yarns in my kitchen with acid dyes in small batches. This produces vibrant and unique skeins of yarn.

      <h3>Spinning</h3>
      <img src="./img_html_me/spinningwheel.jpg"/>
        
        <p>I spin my yarn on a Schact Sidekick spinning wheel or one of a variety of drop spindles. Spinning yarn is an amazing process that I find to be relaxing and zen like. Its kind of like meditating. It's important to me to keep this skill alive because it almost died out in the late 1960's and early 1970's when acrylic yarn became widely available in local stores.
            If I'm working on a large project and need lots of the exact same yarn I will use the spinning wheel to spin it. If I'm just sampling a small amount of wool to see how it will spin up, I'll  use a hand-held drop spindle to spin the yarn. Sometimes I just want to have a portable project that can be easily carried and worked on just about anywhere, so I'll choose a small Turkish spindle and some combed top ( one syte of wool preparation. Yes, there several ways to prepare wool for spinning!) to spin.</p>
